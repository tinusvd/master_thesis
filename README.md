This is the reposity for the master's thesis: "How to Evaluate Causal Dominance Hypotheses in Multilevel Vector Autoregressive Models" by M.L.G. van Dam, supervised by Dr. Rebecca M. Kuiper. The master's thesis is written for the program: Methodology and Statistics for the Behavioural, Biomedical, and Social Sciences at Utrecht University (UU). 

The repository consists of three main aspects:
- A data archive with all the necessary R scripts to reproduce the results;
- An archive of the empirical example with R script to analyze data in a multilevel VAR(1) model and evaluate hypotheses with the GORICA at both the between- and within-subject levels, and data to reproduce the example in the thesis;
- The supplementary material of the thesis.

For the data archive, we refer to the README in said map.
